# Emotion AI
Emotion AI detects and interprets human emotions using ML, computer vision, NLP, and sensor/biometric data.
An Emotional AI tutor that detects student confusion from webcam video and chat text, then provides timely hints and adjusts lesson pace. It uses facial action unit detection + text sentiment fused through an attention-based multimodal transformer. The system runs inference locally in the browser (WebAssembly/ONNX) to preserve privacy, logs anonymized engagement scores, and offers teachers a dashboard with explainable cues.
